    words                          shift and go to state 2

state 1

    (0) S' -> text .



state 2

    (1) text -> words .
    (2) words -> words . WORD

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (text -> words .)

state 3

    (3) words -> WORD .

    WORD            reduce using rule 3 (words -> WORD .)
    $end            reduce using rule 3 (words -> WORD .)


state 4

    (2) words -> words WORD .

    WORD            reduce using rule 2 (words -> words WORD .)
